## Food for thought

Mark and Mary are researchers at a university. They got some great results, which they submitted to a high-profile journal. The reviews were positive, but reviewers asked for some new figures, alternative analysis and a change to existing figures.
Mark and Mary started to work on revisions, but when they tried to generate modified figures, it didn't match with previous results. The new figures were different from what they found before and didn't show the same trends. Mary usually keeps track of which code has generated which figures, but she was in a rush to submit the paper before a deadline. She forgot to keep track of the files as usual.
Mary has left university for a job in industry and ever since the manuscript is languishing in the drawer.

In many cases, we have to start from existing work.

## Why reproducible research?
   - To show evidence of the correctness of our results
   - Long term value of data
   - Uniqueness of data, i.e., data collected today may be invalid/inappropriate 6 months
     from now
   - Publications after 2 years data collection ends
   - We want to repeat the same experiment with different data and settings, many months later 
   - Saves a great deal of time in transmitting knowledge to future researchers

## Why all the talk about reproducible research?
   - A recent [survey](http://www.nature.com/news/1-500-scientists-lift-the-lid-on-reproducibility-1.19970) in Nature revealed that irreproducible experiments are a problem across all domains of science.

   - Another online [survey](http://www.ascb.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/final-survey-results-without-Q11.pdf) of nearly 900 members of the American Society for Cell Biology reveals that most of the research was irreproducible.
